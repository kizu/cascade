Drew Powers wrote up some thoughts about how to make sure that UI is really polished and described it as [the 3 layers of UI interaction](https://pow.rs/blog/3-layers-of-ui-interaction/):

> 1. Render area: where does this element appear?
> 2. Hit area: what is the shape/size/placement of the invisible interactive area?
> 3. Focus area: when Tab-ing, what is the focus ring shape/placement?

What happens when you donâ€™t care for these things? Well, I reckon everything about a UI then feels uncertain and I tend to navigate around with a real lack of confidence.
