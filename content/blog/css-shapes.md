Making shapes with CSS will never fail to impress me and I just spotted this great resource by Temani Afif that has [a ton of examples](https://css-shape.com/). You’ve got the basics, like squares, triangles, and circles but then the more wild examples like [ribbons](https://css-generators.com/ribbon-shapes/) and [grid lines](https://css-shape.com/grid-lines/). Great stuff.

Also, completely unrelated to all this, but I had a lot of fun scrolling through Temani’s work on Codepen. Especially this trippy, [3d parallax effect](https://codepen.io/t_afif/pen/qBJyXNy) and this, the ultimate CSS shape of them all: [a CSS-only Goku](https://codepen.io/t_afif/pen/VwrXNJp).
