Ahmad Shadeed has written another beautifully designed and polished deep-dive but this time all about the `gap` property. Sometimes it’s nice to go back in time and remember all the negative-margin hacks and complicated layout-related code we had to write just to space things apart. Thankfully no longer!

Another thing Ahmad’s post reminded me is that not only is `gap` straight up easier to use than managing a lot of `margin` declarations, but it also prevents layout bugs too. On this thread, [Ahmad writes](https://ishadeed.com/article/the-gap/): 

> Building a UI that doesn’t break is impossible, but at least, you can reduce the issues that might happen:

> - Make sure to stress-test the UI for any spacing issues.
