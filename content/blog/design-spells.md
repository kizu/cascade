[Design Spells](https://www.designspells.com/) is a big collection of animations and fun, interactive details taken from all over the web. Lots of these are stressful and overwhelming to me but there’s some particularly absurd things in here I love like [Webflow’s ridiculous 404 page](https://www.designspells.com/spells/editable-margins-on-webflows-404-page) or [Vercel’s interactive conference badge](https://www.designspells.com/spells/digital-badge-and-lanyard-for-virtual-attendees-of-vercels-conference).

If you’re looking for something to make a Codepen out of, then this is also a fantastic resource to pick something, copy it, and learn how they made it under the hood.
