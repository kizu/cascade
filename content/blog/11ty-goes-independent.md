[This is super cool](https://www.zachleat.com/web/independent-sustainable-11ty/):

> ...11ty is making some bigger moves: we’re going all-in to create a fully independent and sustainable, grass-roots funded open source project in 2024.
>
> Practically speaking this means that for the very first time in 11ty’s history, I will be working independently on 11ty full time. This means increased iteration speed, more responsive official support, more features and bug fixes, and faster releases.

Exciting stuff! It’s no secret that I’m an [11ty](https://11ty.dev) super fan since this very website is powered by it [under the hood](https://github.com/robinrendle/cascade/tree/main). Either way, if you or business can help out here, [go support this thing](https://opencollective.com/11ty) and help make the web a better place.
