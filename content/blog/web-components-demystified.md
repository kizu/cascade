Scott Jehl just kickstarted [his course on web components](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scott-jehl/web-components-demystified) and it just sounds great:

> Fortunately, we now have [a standard component model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) built right into our browsers, and using its various technologies can help us cut delivery weight and reduce complexity. Many of the largest companies in the world have already begun transitioning their sites and design systems to use web components, and major JavaScript libraries like React [have greatly improved their compatibility to work](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/new-react-19-features/) with them as well. And while web components are indeed ready for production today, in the coming months several specifications are shaping up to make them even better. This course aims to cover all of that.

Canâ€™t wait.
