Andy Bell set out to convert all the hex colors (like #FFFFFF for white) into p3 colors and [wrote up his process](https://piccalil.li/blog/applying-p3-colours-on-an-existing-project/):

> I’ll be honest. I am not smart enough to explain the new colour systems that CSS has in its ever-expanding toolset. What I can do though, is show you what a major impact they can have with not much effort.

Andy also links to [hexp3.com](https://hexp3.com/) which lets ya pass in any hex value and it’ll do its best to transform it into a p3 color.
