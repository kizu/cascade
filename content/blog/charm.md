Since I’ve been working as a designer for a few years now, I’ve felt like I needed to upgrade my command line chops. So I downloaded [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) and fell down a big rabbit hole of futzing and playing with everything I’d missed or ignored over the years.

This led me to [Charm](https://charm.sh/), a group of folks who make super interesting command line tools. They make stuff like [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) which helps you create GIFs of your terminal, or [Pop](https://github.com/charmbracelet/pop) that lets you send email via the command line. [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) is neat too, it’s a set of components for building your own CLI tools. 

The one thing that I love about Charm is that they clearly spend an awful lot of time polishing their work. From the website to the README, everything is clear and everything shines with thoughtfulness. I especially loved [this post about their process](https://charm.sh/blog/100k/) by Christian Rocha:

> The README is critically important to the success of an open source product. It’s often a developer’s first point of contact with a project and the place where a developer will, in a matter of seconds, judge whether the project worthy of further consideration. With this in mind, put a lot of effort into README design, optimizing for strong first impressions.

> Our strategy is to simply follow the age-old rule of advertising: showing the product. Good products, when presented correctly, will sell themselves, which is why we spend spend so much time on user experience and attention to detail.
