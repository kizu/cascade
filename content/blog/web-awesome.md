Iâ€™m real late to the party here but the folks behind Font Awesome have just a few days left to go on their incredibly successful Kickstarter project, [Web Awesome](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome):

> Web Awesome provides a collection of meticulously designed, highly customizable UI components built on a framework agnostic technology. Why spend hundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch? Why make a component library that only works with one framework?
