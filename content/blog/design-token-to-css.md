The other day [I mentioned](https://www.csscade.com/how-to-create-css-utility-classes) Saneef Ansari’s excellent [postcss-design-token-utils](https://github.com/saneef/postcss-design-token-utils) that converts a bunch of JSON into custom CSS properties and utility classes. At the end I aggressively rambled about how much I’d love to see this as a dedicated website and, well, Saneef built the darn thing!

It’s called [Design Token to CSS](https://tokens2css.nanools.com/) and it’s very much worth checking out. I’ve fallen out of the loop a little bit when it comes to syncing design tokens like this between Figma and your front-end codebase but I imagine this is _extremely_ helpful for keeping designers and engineers on the same page there.

Also! This tool is part of Saneef’s collection of “nano-sized tools for web designers” called [nanools](https://nanools.com/) which I had never seen before but holy heck is [color × color](https://colorcolor.in/) worth looking at as well. It lets you build full blown color systems—but I especially love how Saneef goes about explaining luminance, chroma, and hue.
